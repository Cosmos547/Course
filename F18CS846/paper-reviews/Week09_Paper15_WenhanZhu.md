### Feature Lifecycles as They Spread, migrate, Remain and Die in App Stores

#### Summary

This paper took a look at feature migration during 2 snap shot of apps from Blackberry World and Samsung Apps store to explore features' effect on apps. The authors gave a formal definition of feature migration in their mind and did analysis on the results from the 2 app stores. The results show some similarity and slight differences in two stores. One most interesting is that features that are unique and doesn't migrate away from one category of apps are likely to be what defines the category. And some features affect the price of the apps.

#### Things I would like to see discussed about
- I would really like to see if there are more work done on this topic since arguably the mobile world changed a lot during the years and both the apps stores the research in based on are not relevant anymore.  
- How accurate are the features. The authors utilizes NLP methods to extract the features and surveyed developers to make sure that their classification is correct. However, base on the few mentions of exact features it seems like that it could happen that the same feature could be worded differently and affect the results.
- Is the data gathered large enough? One of the tables showed the number of apps per category and some of them are really small. Does the data suggest general cases?
