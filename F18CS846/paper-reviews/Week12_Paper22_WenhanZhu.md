# Usage, Costs, and Benefits of Continuous Integration in Open-Source projects

### Summary
The authors proposed the first large scale study on CI systems on open source software. A large dataset is collected from GitHub and Travis CI which is the most popular CI platform used on Github. They also surveyed developers from the top 1,000 popular projects on Github on their opinion on CI systems.  Then the author evaluated a lot of questions regarding the used of CI systems. They found out that CI systems are used widely and popular projects are more likely to use CI systems. They also observed that the popularity of the language does not indicate the usage of CI. From the survey they found out that people are likely to still used CI and the main obstacle in the familiarity of CI system. So they predict that CI will be used more broadly in the future.

### Things I would like to see discussed

- Many results are statistically concluded by average or mean. But no reasoning was given on why they behave that way. Are there explanations on those results recently.

- Table 3 shows HTML. HTML is a scripting language, how does CI work on that? Or if it's a mislabel by GitHub. (Also for CSS)

- Figure 2 shows that the number of projects using CI. It contradicts the claim that the median adoption time is one year on the depth database.
