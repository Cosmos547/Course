**The Ultimate Debian Database: Consolidating Bazaar Metadata for Quality Assurance and Data Mining**

This paper discussed how a database that contains all Debian development information is implemented. The authors of this paper worked with the Debian developers to gather the data and confirmed many theories about the Debian development. Some main focus of the database is the type of packages and it's *flow* of development. It also discusses problems that could be avoided mainly dependency problem by constructing such database.

Things I would to see discussed:
1. The database is very specific for Debian, I would like to see if similar things with other distributions
2. The dependency problem does not seems to be fixed, want to see more insight on this topic.
3. Acquisition of data. Since the work is done with Debian developers the data can be easily gathered and shared among the authors. I would like to see more on the data collecting part to see how it can be generized to other distributions.
